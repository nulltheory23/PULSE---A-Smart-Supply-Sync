        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>PULSE</strong> is a local-level healthcare supply coordination platform designed to reduce shortages and wastage during disease outbreaks.
        </p>

        <p>
            PULSE addresses this problem by connecting hospitals and clinics within a city through a centralized system. The platform provides real-time visibility of available and required medical supplies, enables facilities to raise urgent requests, and suggests nearby hospitals that can support them based on availability and proximity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our goal is to support faster decision-making, reduce supply wastage, and ensure that critical medical resources reach the facilities that need them most—when they need them.
        </p>
